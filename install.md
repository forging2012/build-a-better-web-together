# Installation

The only requirement is the [Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/dl/), at least version 1.8 but **1.9** is highly recommended.

```sh
$ go get -u github.com/kataras/iris
```

> _iris_ takes advantage of the [vendor directory](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bz5-UB7g2uPBdOx-rw5t9MxJwkfpx90cqG9AFL0JAYo) feature. You get truly reproducible builds, as this method guards against upstream renames and deletes.
